Map, reduce, forEach, and filter for objects. Lazy evaluation, no dependencies.

### Why should you care?

I wanted a library that has no dependencies and gives me the basic map/reduce/filter for use on objects. Any existing library I found has boatloads of dependencies, provides tons more extra tools, and/or is unmaintained. So here's `ObjectFn`, just for you!

Also, big props to [@declandewet](https://github.com/jescalan) for the initial implementation of this library!

### Installation

`npm install objectfn -S`

> **Note:** This project is compatible with node v6+ only

### Usage

Very straightforward usage. Just import what you need and use it on an object.

```js
const {map, reduce, filter, forEach} = require('objectfn')

const obj = { foo: 'bar', wow: 'doge' }
map(obj, (v, k) => v.toUpperCase())
// { foo: 'BAR', wow: 'DOGE' }
reduce(obj, (m, v, k) => m[v.toUpperCase()] = k && m }, {})
// { FOO: 'bar', WOW: 'doge' }
filter(obj, (v, k) => !k === 'foo')
// { wow: 'doge' }
forEach(obj, console.log)
// logs out all the values
```
